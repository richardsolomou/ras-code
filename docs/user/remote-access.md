# Remote access

Connect a phone, browser, or another desktop app to RAS Code running on a different
machine. That machine must stay running and reachable while you work.

## RAS Connect

RAS Connect makes an environment available to your other devices without setting
up router forwarding. In the desktop app on the host, open **Settings →
Connections**, sign in, and enable **RAS Connect** for that environment.

For a command-line host, run:

```bash
npx ras-code@latest connect
```

On your other device, sign in to the same RAS Connect account and choose the
environment. Over SSH, the CLI prints a browser link and accepts the returned
authorization code, so you do not need to forward an OAuth callback port.

## Pair over a LAN or private network

Use direct pairing when the other device can reach the host's network address.

On a desktop host, open **Settings → Connections**, enable **Network access**,
then create a pairing link using an address the other device can reach. Changing
network access restarts the desktop app. You can turn it off in the same place.

For a command-line host, replace `<private-ip>` with the host's LAN or tailnet
address:

```bash
npx ras-code serve --host <private-ip>
```

If a server is already running, generate a fresh link without restarting it:

```bash
npx ras-code pair
```

Scan the QR code on your phone or paste the pairing URL into **Add environment**
in the receiving app. Connection settings are under **Settings → Connections**
on web and desktop and **Settings → Environments** on mobile. A loopback address
such as `127.0.0.1` reaches only the device opening the link.

Pairing authorizes that device for future connections. Use a fresh one-time link
for each new device; you do not need the original token to reconnect. Links
created in Settings can only be copied from the client that created them while
its Connections page stays open. If you leave or reload that page, create
another link to share.

### Tailscale HTTPS

Join both devices to the same tailnet. In the desktop app, enable **Tailscale
HTTPS** in **Settings → Connections**. Turn it off there to remove that route.

If no server is running, `ras pair` says so and points you at `npx ras-code serve` or `npx ras-code connect`.

## Recommended Setup

Use a trusted private network that meshes your devices together, such as a tailnet.

That gives you:

- a stable address to connect to
- transport security at the network layer
- less exposure than opening the server to the public internet

## Enabling Network Access

There are three ways to reach your server from another device: expose the desktop app's backend,
run a headless server from the CLI, or have the desktop app launch RAS Code over SSH.

### Option 1: Desktop App

If you are already running the desktop app and want to make it reachable from other devices:

1. Open **Settings** → **Connections**.
2. Under **This environment**, toggle **Network access** on. This will restart the app and run the backend on all network interfaces.
3. The settings panel will show the default reachable endpoint, with a `+N` control when more endpoints are available. Expand it to inspect alternatives such as loopback, LAN, private-network, or HTTPS endpoints.
4. Use **Create Link** to generate a pairing link you can share with another device.

Pairing codes and share links are available only in the client that created them,
while its Connections page remains open. After you leave the page or reload it,
create a new link to share. Other clients can see the active link's name, scopes,
and expiry, and can revoke it if they have access management permission.

The default endpoint controls the QR code and primary copy action for pairing links. You can change it from the expanded endpoint list. The preference is stored by endpoint type, so choosing the local LAN endpoint survives normal IP address changes when you move between networks.

After an app restart, the desktop app replaces its previous
local credential. Old local desktop entries are removed from **Authorized clients**
automatically. Paired phones, browsers, and remote desktop clients keep their access.

When no user default is saved, the app uses the built-in LAN endpoint for pairing links when
available. You can set another endpoint as the default from the expanded endpoint list.

- HTTPS/WSS-compatible endpoints work from `https://code.ras.sh/app`, but are not made the default
  automatically.
- Non-loopback HTTP endpoints are useful for direct LAN pairing.
- Loopback-only endpoints are not useful for another device unless that device is the same machine.

If the copied link points directly at `http://192.168.x.y:3773`, open it from a client that can reach that LAN address. If it points at `https://code.ras.sh/app/pair?...`, the hosted web app will save the environment and connect directly to the backend URL in the link.

In the mobile app's **Add Environment** form, a numeric IP address without a scheme uses HTTP. Include `https://` explicitly when the backend is served over HTTPS.

### Tailscale Endpoints

When the desktop app can detect Tailscale, it adds Tailnet endpoints to the reachable endpoint list.

Depending on your Tailscale setup, this may include:

- the machine's `100.x.y.z` Tailnet IP
- a MagicDNS name
- an HTTPS MagicDNS endpoint when Tailscale Serve is configured for this backend

The Tailscale HTTPS endpoint uses the clean MagicDNS URL, such as
`https://machine.tailnet.ts.net/`, and is off until you opt in. Turn on **Enable Tailscale HTTPS**
on the **Tailscale HTTPS** row in **Settings** → **Connections**. The desktop app restarts the
backend with the same server-side behavior as `ras serve --tailscale-serve`, then the server asks
Tailscale Serve to proxy HTTPS traffic to the local backend. Turn the same switch off to stop it.

The Tailscale support is an endpoint provider add-on. The core remote model still works without Tailscale: LAN HTTP endpoints, custom HTTPS endpoints, managed relay endpoints, and SSH-launched environments all use the same saved environment and pairing flow.

For `https://code.ras.sh/app`, prefer an HTTPS Tailnet or other HTTPS endpoint. A plain `http://100.x.y.z:3773` endpoint can still work from a desktop client or another browser page served over HTTP, but it will not work from the hosted HTTPS app because of browser mixed-content rules.

### Option 1: RAS Connect

RAS Connect gives a linked environment a public HTTPS/WSS endpoint without opening an inbound port
or depending on the machine's LAN address. Sign in under **Settings** → **Connections**, then link
the environment. On a headless machine, run:

```bash
npx ras-code connect
```

The CLI authorizes the machine, and the RAS Code server starts its built-in outbound relay connector.
The RAS-hosted service publishes environments below
`https://code-tunnels.ras.sh/e/<endpoint-id>/`; the endpoint ID is only a routing identifier, while
normal RAS Code pairing and DPoP-bound session authentication still control access.

Use `ras connect status`, `ras connect unlink`, and `ras connect logout` to inspect or remove the
link. RAS Connect must be configured by the distributor or self-hosting operator; source builds
without public Clerk and relay configuration leave the cloud controls disabled.

A linked environment is reachable only while its machine is awake and its server is running. When a
laptop suspends or changes network, the environment shows as offline and connecting to it reports
that its RAS Code server is not connected to the relay. The server reconnects on its own once the
machine is back, normally within a minute; you do not need to restart it.

### Option 2: Headless Server (CLI)

Use this when you want to run the server without a GUI, for example on a remote machine over SSH.

Run the server with `ras serve`.

```bash
npx ras-code serve --host "$(tailscale ip -4)"
```

`ras serve` starts the server without opening a browser and prints:

- a connection string
- a pairing token
- a pairing URL
- a QR code for the pairing URL

From there, connect from another device in either of these ways:

- scan the QR code on your phone
- in the desktop app, enter the full pairing URL
- in the desktop app, enter the host and token separately
- in the hosted web app, open a hosted pairing URL when the backend is reachable over HTTPS

Use `ras serve --help` for the full flag reference. It supports the same general startup options as the normal server command, including an optional `cwd` argument.

For hosted web pairing over Tailscale HTTPS, opt in to Tailscale Serve:

```bash
npx ras-code serve --tailscale-serve
```

For an already-running server:

```bash
npx ras-code pair --tailscale
```

The pairing link uses an address such as `https://machine.tailnet.ts.net/`.
The mapping created by `pair --tailscale` persists across restarts. Remove its
default-port mapping with:

### Option 3: Desktop-Managed SSH Launch

Use this when you want the desktop app to start or reuse RAS Code on another machine over SSH.

1. Open **Settings** → **Connections**.
2. Under **Remote Environments**, choose **Add environment**.
3. Select the SSH launch flow.
4. Enter the SSH target, such as `user@example.com`.
5. Confirm the launch. The desktop app probes the host, starts or reuses a remote RAS Code server, opens a local port forward, and saves the environment.

After setup, the renderer connects to a local forwarded HTTP/WebSocket endpoint. The remote host still owns the actual RAS Code server, projects, files, git state, terminals, and provider sessions.

SSH launch is a desktop feature because it needs local process and SSH access. Once the environment is paired and saved, it uses the same environment list and connection model as direct LAN, Tailscale, HTTPS, or managed relay-backed environments.

#### SSH Launch Troubleshooting

The desktop SSH launcher connects with a non-interactive `sh` session, writes a small launcher script under `~/.ras-code/ssh-launch/<host-key>/`, starts or reuses a remote RAS Code server, and forwards the remote loopback port back to your desktop.

The remote host must have a compatible Node.js runtime. RAS Code uses the server package's `engines.node` requirement:

```text
^22.16 || ^23.11 || >=24.10
```

If that port is already in use, choose another with
`--tailscale-serve-port`. See `npx ras-code pair --help` for other pairing options.

### Hosted web app

[app.t3.codes](https://app.t3.codes) needs an HTTPS endpoint. It connects directly
to your server; a hosted pairing link does not make an unreachable backend
reachable or convert HTTP to HTTPS.

For a plain HTTP LAN endpoint, use the direct pairing URL in a browser that can
open it, or pair from the desktop app. On mobile, an IP address entered without a
scheme uses HTTP, so include `https://` when your server uses HTTPS.

## Desktop-managed SSH

In the desktop app, open **Settings → Connections → Add environment**, choose
**SSH**, and enter a host or SSH alias such as `user@example.com`. RAS Code starts
or reuses a server there and opens the port forward for you. Projects, provider
credentials, and agent work stay on the remote machine.

The remote host needs a compatible [Node.js installation](./install.md#requirements)
and [provider setup](./install.md#providers). If launch cannot find Node or reports
an incompatible version, check it through a non-interactive SSH session:

```bash
ssh user@example.com 'sh -lc "command -v node && node --version"'
```

Configure your version manager for non-interactive shells if this differs from
your normal terminal. With nvm, setting a compatible default, such as
`nvm alias default 24`, can resolve the problem.

If SSH reconnecting fails after an app update, retry the launch once. Removing
the connection stops a server that RAS Code launched; a server that was already
running is left alone.

For Antigravity's Google callback on a remote host, see
[remote sign-in](./providers-antigravity.md#sign-in-from-a-remote-device).

## Manage or revoke access

On the host, **Settings → Connections** lets authorized administrators create
pairing links and revoke client sessions. Revoking an unused link prevents new
pairings; revoke a device's session to remove its existing access. Command-line
management is available through `npx ras-code auth --help`.

To remove an environment from RAS Connect, open your account menu's **RAS Connect**
page, or **Settings → RAS Connect** on mobile, and choose **Deregister**. This
revokes its cloud access and frees its host space even when the environment is
offline or has been wiped.

On a command-line host, `ras connect unlink` disables exposure while retaining
your login; `ras connect logout` also clears that login. Background-service
[removal](./background-service.md#manage-the-service) is separate.

Treat pairing URLs and authorization codes as passwords. Do not include them in
screenshots, logs, or bug reports.

## RAS Connect troubleshooting

Run `ras connect status` on the host to inspect saved authorization and link
configuration. It is not a live reachability check. If the environment appears
offline, run `ras service status` and read the displayed log. If it disappears
when SSH closes, see [background-service troubleshooting](./background-service.md#troubleshooting).

After fixing a permanent rejection, restart the host's server. On Linux, use
`systemctl --user restart ras-code.service` for the background service. For a
foreground server, stop it and run `ras serve` again with your usual options.
Include the diagnostic message and trace ID when reporting a persistent failure.

Finish active work before updating because the server restarts briefly. For step-by-step guidance,
see [Keeping RAS Code in Sync](./updating.md).

On a Linux host, you can keep the server running after logout and manage it independently of the
connection method. See [Running RAS Code in the Background](./background-service.md).

## Settings on a Connected Device

Some settings belong to the device that runs your agents rather than to the app you are looking at:
the default model, new-thread defaults, where **Add Project** starts browsing, background activity,
provider configuration, source control writing style, and agent browser access. They are stored on
that device, so every client you connect from sees the same values.

When more than one device is connected, those settings sections show a row of device tabs. Pick a
device to read and change its settings; the choice carries across the settings pages. Settings that
belong to the app you are using — appearance, fonts, time format, sidebar behavior — have no device
tabs and stay local to that app.

The hosted web app has no device of its own, so it always shows the settings of the device you
select. Connect at least one device before changing them.

## How Pairing Works

The remote device does not need a long-lived secret up front.

Instead:

1. `ras serve` issues a one-time owner pairing token.
2. The remote device exchanges that token with the server.
3. The server creates an authenticated session for that device.

After pairing, future access is session-based. You do not need to keep reusing the original token unless you are pairing a new device.

## Hosted Web App Pairing

The hosted web app at `https://code.ras.sh/app` can save a remote backend in browser local storage from a URL like:

```text
https://code.ras.sh/app/pair?host=https://backend.example.com:3773#token=PAIRCODE
```

Use hosted pairing when the backend is reachable from the browser over HTTPS/WSS. This includes a backend behind a trusted HTTPS tunnel or another HTTPS endpoint you operate.

Do not use hosted pairing for plain HTTP LAN URLs such as `http://192.168.x.y:3773`. Browsers block an HTTPS page from connecting to an insecure HTTP or WS backend. For those endpoints, use the direct pairing URL shown by the desktop app or CLI from a client that can open that HTTP URL directly.

Hosted pairing does not proxy traffic through RAS Code. The browser still connects directly to the backend URL in the pairing link.

## Managing Access Later

Use `ras auth` to manage access after the initial pairing flow.

Typical uses:

- issue additional pairing credentials
- inspect active sessions
- revoke old pairing links or sessions

Use `ras auth --help` and the nested subcommand help pages for the full reference.

### Deregister a RAS Connect Environment

Open your account menu and choose **RAS Connect** to see every environment registered to your
account. On mobile, open **Settings** → **RAS Connect**. Choose **Deregister** to revoke an
environment's RAS Connect access, disconnect its relay session, and remove its hosted link.

Deregistration is an account action and does not need a connection to the environment, so it also
works for a server that was wiped or is no longer reachable. Device-local connect and disconnect
controls remain in **Settings** → **Connections** on web and desktop or **Settings** →
**Environments** on mobile.

## Security Notes

- Treat pairing URLs and pairing tokens like passwords.
- Prefer binding `--host` to a trusted private address, such as a Tailnet IP, instead of exposing the server broadly.
- Anyone with a valid pairing credential can create a session until that credential expires or is revoked.
- Hosted pairing links keep the credential in the URL hash so it is not sent to the hosted app server, but it can still be exposed through browser history, screenshots, logs, or copy/paste.
- Use `ras auth` to revoke credentials or sessions you no longer trust.

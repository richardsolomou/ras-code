# Running RAS Code in the background

On Linux and macOS, RAS Code can run as a service for your user so you do not need
to keep a terminal open.

## Manage the service

Run these commands on the machine that will host RAS Code:

| Task                            | Command                                 |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Install and start               | `npx ras-code@latest service install`   |
| Inspect status and log location | `npx ras-code@latest service status`    |
| Update or repair                | `npx ras-code@latest service update`    |
| Stop and remove from startup    | `npx ras-code@latest service uninstall` |

Uninstalling the service leaves your projects, threads, and settings intact.

Install and update use the version of the CLI you invoke. For nightly, use
`npx ras-code@nightly service update`; replace `nightly` with an exact version to pin
one. An older CLI refuses to replace a newer service unless you explicitly add
`--allow-downgrade`.

Updating restarts the server. Finish active work first, and wait for any remote
update already in progress. To match a remote client's version, follow
[Updating RAS Code](./updating.md).

## Platform support

Linux needs systemd user services. Setup enables lingering so RAS Code starts at
boot and keeps running after logout. If this needs administrator permission,
setup prints a recovery command before changing the service.

macOS starts the service when you log in and stops it when you log out. Keep the
Mac logged in and awake for unattended remote access. Installing over SSH while
nobody is logged in at the Mac's screen can fail at the final start step; the
service is still installed and will start at the next login.

Windows background services are not supported.

RAS Connect can offer service installation during setup, but the two are managed
separately. Signing out of RAS Connect does not stop or uninstall the service.

## Troubleshooting

Start with `ras service status` on the host. It prints the log path and, on Linux,
checks whether the installed service is running, enabled, and allowed to survive
logout.

| Code                       | What it means                                                                    | Recovery                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `linger-disabled`          | The service stops after your last login session ends and does not start at boot. | Run `sudo loginctl enable-linger "$(id -un)"`, then retry setup as your normal user.                                                       |
| `linger-unavailable`       | RAS Code could not verify the logout setting.                                    | Run `loginctl show-user "$(id -un)" --property=Linger` and check that systemd-logind is available.                                         |
| `user-manager-unavailable` | RAS Code cannot reach your systemd user manager.                                 | Run `systemctl --user status` in a login session for the service user. Install your distribution's systemd user-session support if needed. |
| `service-disabled`         | The service is not enabled to start automatically.                               | Run the repair command shown by `ras service status`.                                                                                      |
| `service-stopped`          | The service is installed but is not running.                                     | Read the service log and `systemctl --user status ras-code.service`, then run the displayed repair command.                                |

```sh
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$(id -un)"
```

Over SSH, allow sudo to prompt:

```sh
ssh -t your-server 'sudo loginctl enable-linger "$(id -un)"'
```

Then retry service setup as your normal user. Run only the `loginctl` command
with sudo; running RAS Code as root creates a separate installation and Connect
identity. Without administrator access, run `ras serve` in a terminal and keep
that session open.

| Status problem                          | Next step                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `linger-unavailable`                    | Run `loginctl show-user "$(id -un)" --property=Linger` and check that systemd-logind is available.                             |
| `user-manager-unavailable`              | Run `systemctl --user status` in a login session for the service user; check your distribution's systemd user-session support. |
| `service-disabled` or `service-stopped` | Read the log and `systemctl --user status ras-code.service`, then use the repair command printed by RAS Code.                  |

On macOS, check **System Settings → General → Login Items** if the service no
longer starts at login. If agent work cannot access Desktop, Documents, or
Downloads, it may need Full Disk Access for the Node executable listed in
`ProgramArguments` in
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.richardsolomou.ras-code.service.plist`.

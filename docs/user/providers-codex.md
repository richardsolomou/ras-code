# Codex

This guide is for people who want to use more than one Codex account in RAS Code. For Claude, see
[Claude](./providers-claude.md). For first-time setup, see [Install RAS Code](./install.md).

Common reasons:

- use a work account for work projects
- use a personal account for personal projects
- switch to another account when one account hits limits
- keep one shared Codex history instead of maintaining two separate Codex setups

## I Only Use One Codex Account

Use the default provider.

In Settings, your Codex provider can stay like this:

```text
Display name: Codex
CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex
Shadow home path: empty
```

Log in with Codex normally:

```bash
codex login
```

## Send feedback to OpenAI

In an existing Codex thread, send `/feedback` or `/feedback` followed by a description of the
issue. RAS Code uploads the thread and Codex logs to OpenAI and shows a thread ID that you can copy
and share with OpenAI employees.

## Answer questions while Codex works

Codex can ask questions without stopping its work. Choose a suggested answer or enter your own
in the question panel. Questions without suggested answers accept text.

Your answers are sent as a new message. They reach the current turn while Codex is working, or
start a new turn if it has finished. Unanswered questions stay available after you reconnect.
This works in the web, desktop, and mobile apps. Codex must support async questions.

## Sub-agent models

The web and desktop Agents panel shows each sub-agent's model and reasoning effort when Codex
reports them. If Codex does not report either value, RAS Code leaves it out instead of using the
parent agent's settings.

## Browser and computer activity

Browser and Computer Use calls show their user-facing task title when Codex provides one. Expanded
activity groups show an icon for every call. Website calls use the active page's favicon when it is
available, and desktop app calls use the app's native icon on macOS when available. Other hosts use
a generic fallback glyph.

Collapsed activity groups are summarized by source, such as `Used Chrome integration`, instead of
showing the underlying tool name. Website favicons and native app icons keep their original colors;
integrations that provide separate light and dark logos use the logo for the current appearance.

## Approve access to other apps

When a Codex tool needs access to an app such as Safari, RAS Code shows the app name and asks for
approval. You can approve, decline, or cancel the request from the desktop app, web app, or mobile
app. Some tools also offer approval for the current session or permanent approval.

## I Want Work And Personal Codex Accounts

Use one real Codex home and one shadow home.

Recommended setup:

```text
~/.codex      shared Codex home
~/.codex_p    second account auth
```

The idea is:

- both accounts can see the same RAS Code/Codex sessions
- each account keeps its own login
- existing threads can continue with either account

### Set Up The First Account

Log in normally:

```bash
codex login
```

This is the account used by `~/.codex`.

In RAS Code Settings, name it something obvious:

```text
Display name: Codex Work
CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex
Shadow home path: empty
```

### Set Up The Second Account

Log in with a separate Codex home:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex_p
CODEX_HOME=~/.codex_p codex login
```

In RAS Code Settings, add another Codex provider:

```text
Display name: Codex Personal
CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex
Shadow home path: ~/.codex_p
```

The important part is that both providers use the same `CODEX_HOME path`, but only the second one
has a `Shadow home path`.

## Switching Accounts When One Runs Out

RAS Code does this for you. When the account running a thread hits its usage limit, RAS Code asks
whether to continue on your other Codex account or to wait for the reset. It names the account it
would move to. Answer once for each limit. Every later turn in that window continues there without
a question.

With the recommended shared-home setup, the thread keeps its Codex conversation and replays
nothing. RAS Code tries your original account again on the first turn after its reset, and tells you
when the thread is back on it.

RAS Code skips an account that is signed in to the same login as the exhausted one, one that is out
of quota itself, and one you have not logged into. If neither account can take the turn and you
have a [PostHog AI Gateway](./providers-posthog-gateway.md) provider, that is offered instead.

## Which Account Am I Using?

Open Settings and look at the provider row.

RAS Code shows the authenticated email for providers that report one. Emails are blurred by default;
click the blurred email to reveal it.

Use display names and accent colors to make accounts easy to tell apart in the model picker.

## I Need A Different API Key Or Endpoint

Use the provider's Environment variables section in Settings.

This is useful when a Codex-compatible setup needs account-specific variables. Add the variables to
the provider instance that should receive them, and mark API keys or tokens as sensitive. Sensitive
values are stored as server secrets and are not sent back to the app after saving.

## Can I Switch Accounts In An Existing Thread?

Yes, when both Codex providers share the same `CODEX_HOME path`.

For example:

```text
Codex Work      CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex
Codex Personal  CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex, Shadow home path: ~/.codex_p
```

Those two providers are considered compatible for continuation, so the locked model picker can show
both.

If you add a third Codex provider with a completely different `CODEX_HOME path`, RAS Code treats it
as a different workspace. It will not be offered for existing threads created under `~/.codex`.

## If Both Accounts Look The Same

If two Codex providers show the same account or the same unexpected model list:

1. Check the email in Settings.
2. Refresh provider status.
3. Confirm the second provider has `Shadow home path` set.
4. Confirm the shadow directory has its own `auth.json`.
5. If you copied `~/.codex` into the shadow directory, remove everything except `auth.json`.

Example cleanup:

```bash
find ~/.codex_p -mindepth 1 ! -name auth.json -exec rm -rf {} +
```

## When To Use A Separate CODEX_HOME

Use a totally separate `CODEX_HOME path` only when you want a separate Codex workspace.

That means separate sessions and less account switching inside old threads. Most dual-account users
should use the shared-home plus shadow-home setup instead.

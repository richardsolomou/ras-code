This document covers the unified release workflow for stable and nightly desktop releases.

## What the workflow does

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Triggers:
  - push tag matching `v*.*.*` for stable releases
  - scheduled nightly check every three hours
  - manual `workflow_dispatch` for either channel
- Runs lint, typecheck, and tests alongside artifact builds. Publishing waits for every check.
- Reads the shared production RAS Connect relay URL and Clerk client configuration before packaging clients.
- Builds four artifacts in parallel for both channels:
  - macOS `arm64` DMG
  - macOS `x64` DMG
  - Linux `x64` AppImage
  - Windows `x64` NSIS installer
- Publishes one GitHub Release with all produced files.
  - Stable tags with a suffix after `X.Y.Z` (for example `1.2.3-alpha.1`) are published as GitHub prereleases.
  - Only plain stable `X.Y.Z` releases are marked as the repository's latest release.
  - Nightly runs are always GitHub prereleases and never marked latest.
  - Automatically generated release notes are pinned to the previous tag in the same channel, so stable compares to the previous stable tag and nightly compares to the previous nightly tag.
- Includes Electron auto-update metadata (for example `latest*.yml`, `nightly*.yml`, and `*.blockmap`) in release assets.
- Publishes the CLI package (`apps/server`, npm package `ras-code`) with OIDC trusted publishing from the same workflow file:
  - stable releases publish npm dist-tag `latest`
  - nightly releases publish npm dist-tag `nightly`
- Deploys the hosted web app to Cloudflare Workers only after a release is published:
  - stable releases deploy the `latest` hosted app channel
  - nightly releases deploy the `nightly` hosted app channel
- Signing is optional and auto-detected per platform from secrets.

## Required release credentials

Stable releases require these GitHub Actions secrets in addition to the platform and deployment
credentials documented below:

- `RELEASE_APP_ID`
- `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`

The finalize job uses them to commit and push aligned package versions to `main` as the Release App.
GitHub Release publication uses the repository-scoped workflow token so it has a rate-limit quota
independent from the shared Release App installation.

## RAS Connect relay deployment

The relay is a shared control plane versioned separately from client releases. Stable and nightly
client builds must point at the same relay so users see the same linked environments when switching
release channels.

`.github/workflows/deploy-relay.yml` deploys Alchemy stage `prod` on every push to `main`. The
release workflow reads the relay URL and Clerk client configuration from the existing `production`
GitHub Actions environment before building desktop, CLI, or hosted web artifacts.

Required repository variables shared by relay deployments:

- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`

Required repository secrets shared by relay deployments:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`

Required `production` environment variables:

- `RELAY_API_ZONE_NAME`
- `RELAY_DATABASE_HOST`
- `RELAY_DATABASE_NAME`
- `RELAY_DATABASE_USER`
- `RELAY_TUNNEL_ZONE_NAME`
- `RELAY_TUNNEL_GATEWAY_DOMAIN`
- `RELAY_TUNNEL_NAMESPACE`
- `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `CLERK_JWT_AUDIENCE`
- `CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE`
- `CLERK_CLI_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
- `APNS_ENVIRONMENT`
- `APNS_TEAM_ID`
- `APNS_KEY_ID`
- `APNS_BUNDLE_ID`

Optional `production` environment variables:

- `RELAY_DOMAIN` when overriding the derived `relay.<RELAY_API_ZONE_NAME>` domain

Required `production` environment secrets:

- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- `APNS_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN`
- `RELAY_DATABASE_PASSWORD`
- `RELAY_DATABASE_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID`
- `RELAY_DATABASE_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET`

The account-scoped repository credentials are consumed by Alchemy while provisioning relay stages; they
are not bound into the relay Worker. Postgres is self-hosted and never exposed on a public port:
cloudflared publishes it as `RELAY_DATABASE_HOST`, a Cloudflare Access application guards that
hostname, and Hyperdrive authenticates with the Access service token. The `prod` stage owns
`RELAY_DATABASE_NAME`; every other stage gets its own `<RELAY_DATABASE_NAME>-<stage>` database on the
same server. Migrations run from the deploy host over `cloudflared access tcp`, which the deploy
workflow opens before the stack runs and closes afterwards.
Production adopts the configured relay API and tunnel DNS zones as retained Cloudflare resources.
Personal stages reference the production-owned zones.

Developers deploy personal stages locally rather than through pull-request automation:

```sh
vp run --filter ras-code-relay deploy --stage "$USER" --env-file .env.local
```

## Hosted web app release deployment

The hosted app is a Cloudflare Worker serving the built SPA as static assets,
deployed by `.github/workflows/release.yml` after the GitHub Release succeeds.
The Alchemy stack lives in `infra/web`, and the deployment stage names the
release channel, so a stage typo cannot publish nightly assets onto the stable
domain.

Required GitHub Actions secrets:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`

Required GitHub Actions variables:

- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `RAS_CODE_WEB_ROUTER_URL`: set to `https://code.ras.sh` for the RAS-hosted deployment.
- `RAS_CODE_WEB_LATEST_DOMAIN`: set to `code-latest.ras.sh` for the RAS-hosted deployment.
- `RAS_CODE_WEB_NIGHTLY_DOMAIN`: set to `code-nightly.ras.sh` for the RAS-hosted deployment.

Worker custom domains, which Alchemy attaches:

- `code.ras.sh`: the router domain users open, served by the `latest` stage.
- `code-latest.ras.sh`: the stable channel, served by the `latest` stage.
- `code-nightly.ras.sh`: the nightly channel, served by the `nightly` stage.

Both channels deploy the same Worker entry, `apps/web/worker.ts`. Only the
`latest` stage receives `RAS_CODE_WEB_ROUTER_HOST` and
`RAS_CODE_WEB_NIGHTLY_ORIGIN`, so only it routes; the nightly deployment serves
its own assets unconditionally. Users opt into a channel by visiting
`/__ras-code/channel?channel=latest` or `/__ras-code/channel?channel=nightly`,
which sets the `ras_code_web_channel` cookie. On the router domain the Worker
reads that cookie and proxies to the nightly origin when it says `nightly`;
otherwise it serves its own assets. Requests to a channel domain are never
proxied, so a stale cookie cannot cause a loop.

The release deploy job rewrites release package versions before the build so the
hosted app's About panel renders the release version. It also passes
`VITE_HOSTED_APP_CHANNEL=latest|nightly`, which renders the hosted update track
selector in the About panel. Changing the selector navigates through
`/__ras-code/channel` on the router domain so the user's channel cookie is
updated before redirecting to the hosted app root.

Deploy a channel by hand with:

```sh
vp run --filter ras-code-web-infra deploy --stage latest --yes
```

## Nightly builds

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Triggers:
  - scheduled check every three hours
  - manual `workflow_dispatch` with `channel=nightly`
- Runs the same desktop quality gates and artifact matrix as the tagged release flow.
- Publishes a GitHub prerelease only:
  - current tag format: `vX.Y.Z-nightly.YYYYMMDD.<run_number>`
  - `nightly-v...` is accepted only as a legacy previous-nightly tag
  - release name includes the short commit SHA
  - `make_latest` is always `false`
- Uses the next stable patch version as the nightly base. For example, `0.0.17` produces nightlies on `0.0.18-nightly.*`.
- Publishes Electron auto-update metadata to the dedicated `nightly` updater channel, so desktop users can opt into that track independently from stable.
- Publishes the CLI package (`apps/server`, npm package `ras-code`) to the `nightly` npm dist-tag using the same nightly version.
- Does not commit version bumps back to `main`.

## Server self-update release invariant

Connected servers update to the client's exact version, not to an npm dist-tag. Every released
desktop or hosted client version must therefore have a matching `ras-code@<version>` package available on
npm before users can receive that client.

The workflow enforces this ordering:

1. `publish_cli` publishes the exact stable or nightly version to npm.
2. `release` depends on `publish_cli` before exposing desktop artifacts in GitHub Releases.
3. `deploy_web` depends on `release` before moving the hosted channel to the new client.

Preserve these dependencies when changing the release graph. Publishing a client first would leave
the **Update server** action targeting a package version that does not exist yet.

For a release smoke test, confirm `npm view ras-code@<version> version` returns the expected version, then
connect the new client to a server on the previous version and verify that the update action
reconnects to the matching server. When the release adds database migrations, verify that the
remote update applies them and reconnects. A failed trial must restore the database snapshot and
restart the previous server. If the installed launcher does not support the target protocol,
verify that the update stops before restart and run `npx ras-code@<version> service update` once on the
server machine. Also test the manual or desktop-managed guidance when those environments are
available.

## Desktop auto-update notes

- Updater runtime: `apps/desktop/src/updates/DesktopUpdates.ts`.
- `electron-updater` adapter: `apps/desktop/src/electron/ElectronUpdater.ts`.
- `apps/desktop/src/main.ts` only wires the updater layers into the desktop runtime.
- Update UX:
  - Background checks run on startup delay + interval.
  - No automatic download or install.
  - The desktop UI shows a rocket update button when an update is available; click once to download, click again after download to restart/install.
- Provider: GitHub Releases (`provider: github`) configured at build time.
- Repository slug source:
  - `RAS_CODE_DESKTOP_UPDATE_REPOSITORY` (format `owner/repo`), if set.
  - otherwise `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` from GitHub Actions.
- Required release assets for updater:
  - platform installers (`.exe`, `.dmg`, `.AppImage`, plus macOS `.zip` for Squirrel.Mac update payloads)
  - channel metadata: `latest*.yml` for stable releases, `nightly*.yml` for nightly releases
  - `*.blockmap` files (used for differential downloads)
- macOS metadata note:
  - `electron-updater` reads `latest-mac.yml` on stable and `nightly-mac.yml` on nightly, for both Intel and Apple Silicon.
  - The workflow merges the per-arch mac manifests into one channel-specific mac manifest before publishing the GitHub Release.

### Windows payload topology and update validation

Windows packages the bundled server and only its runtime-external/native
dependency closure in `resources/server.asar`. Native modules and helper
executables declared as unpacked by that archive must be present at the matching
paths below `resources/server.asar.unpacked`. The Windows-native backend reads
the archive in place through Electron. WSL cannot read ASAR files, so enabling
the WSL backend extracts the server tree once into the desktop state directory
under `wsl-server-tree/<version>` and reuses the completed version until the app
is updated.

The artifact builder rejects a Windows package when any of these invariants
break:

- `resources/server.asar` is absent or does not contain the server entry.
- Any file marked unpacked in the ASAR header is absent from
  `resources/server.asar.unpacked`.
- On same-architecture Windows builds, the packaged primary cannot load the fff
  native library from inside `server.asar` through its `.unpacked` sibling.
- The isolated, extracted sidecar cannot load the server entry with plain Node.
- The external Windows resource monitor is absent.
- The unpacked Windows application contains more than 80 files.

Cross-architecture Windows builds retain every structural and extracted-sidecar
check, but skip executing the target Electron binary. A same-architecture build
for each release target must exercise the primary native-load probe.

NSIS differential packaging remains enabled. A sidecar layout transition can
produce a larger one-time download; subsequent small releases retain their
blockmaps, with a 60 MB maximum for a representative sidecar-to-sidecar update.

## 0) npm OIDC trusted publishing setup (CLI)

The workflow invokes `node apps/server/scripts/cli.ts publish` after aligning package versions. That
script temporarily prepares the `ras-code` package, then runs `vp pm publish --filter ras-code ...` from the
repository root so workspace publish configuration is applied correctly.

Checklist:

1. Confirm npm org/user owns package `ras-code` (or rename package first if needed).
2. In npm package settings, configure Trusted Publisher:
   - Provider: GitHub Actions
   - Repository: this repo
   - Workflow file: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
   - Environment (if used): match your npm trusted publishing config
3. Ensure npm account and org policies allow trusted publishing for the package.
4. Create release tag `vX.Y.Z` and push; workflow will:
   - align the release package versions to `X.Y.Z`
   - build web + server
   - invoke the CLI publish script with npm dist-tag `latest`
5. Nightly runs invoke the same publish script with npm dist-tag `nightly`.

## 1) Release validation and unsigned builds

There is no dry-run tag path. Pushing any accepted non-nightly tag, including
`v0.0.0-test.1`, classifies the run as the stable channel. It publishes `ras-code` with npm dist-tag
`latest`, creates a real GitHub Release, aliases the hosted app to `code-latest.ras.sh` and
`code.ras.sh`, and can commit a version bump to `main` in the finalize job. Do not push a test tag
to validate the workflow.

The workflow has no non-publishing `workflow_dispatch` mode. Use normal CI or local quality gates to
validate checks and builds without shipping. To exercise the complete release graph at lower stable
risk, manually dispatch `channel=nightly`; this still publishes a real nightly npm package, GitHub
prerelease, desktop updater release, and hosted nightly alias, but it does not update stable aliases or
commit a version bump to `main`. Only run it when a real nightly release is acceptable.

Manual `channel=stable` with a version input is also a real stable-channel release. Omitting signing
secrets only makes platform artifacts unsigned; it does not prevent publication.

## 2) Apple signing + notarization setup (macOS)

Required secrets used by the workflow:

- `CSC_LINK`
- `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_API_KEY`
- `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`
- `APPLE_API_ISSUER`
- `MACOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE` (base64-encoded provisioning profile with Associated Domains)

Required repository variables:

- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`

Optional repository variables:

- `CLERK_PASSKEY_RP_DOMAINS`: comma-separated RP-domain override. By default, the build derives the
  domain from the production Clerk publishable key.

Checklist:

1. Apple Developer account access:
   - Team has rights to create Developer ID certificates.
2. Create an explicit App ID for `com.richardsolomou.ras-code` and enable Associated Domains.
3. Create a `Developer ID Application` certificate and a compatible provisioning profile for that
   App ID with Associated Domains enabled.
4. Export the certificate + private key as `.p12` from Keychain.
5. Base64-encode the `.p12` and store as `CSC_LINK`.
6. Base64-encode the provisioning profile and store it as `MACOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE`.
7. Store the `.p12` export password as `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, and set `APPLE_TEAM_ID` to the
   10-character Apple Developer Team ID.
8. In App Store Connect, create an API key (Team key).
9. Add API key values:
   - `APPLE_API_KEY`: contents of the downloaded `.p8`
   - `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`: Key ID
   - `APPLE_API_ISSUER`: Issuer ID
10. Complete the Clerk Native API and AASA setup in [RAS Connect Clerk Setup](../internals/ras-connect.md#desktop-passkeys).
11. Re-run a tag release and confirm macOS artifacts are signed/notarized and contain the expected
    `com.apple.developer.associated-domains` entitlement.

Notes:

- `APPLE_API_KEY` is stored as raw key text in secrets.
- The workflow writes it to a temporary `AuthKey_<id>.p8` file at runtime.
- The workflow decodes `MACOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE`, validates it with `security cms`, and passes it
  to the desktop packager.

## 3) Azure Trusted Signing setup (Windows)

Required secrets used by the workflow:

- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_ACCOUNT_NAME`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE_PROFILE_NAME`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_PUBLISHER_NAME`

Checklist:

1. Create Azure Trusted Signing account and certificate profile.
2. Record ATS values:
   - Endpoint
   - Account name
   - Certificate profile name
   - Publisher name
3. Create/choose an Entra app registration (service principal).
4. Grant service principal permissions required by Trusted Signing.
5. Create a client secret for the service principal.
6. Add Azure secrets listed above in GitHub Actions secrets.
7. Re-run a tag release and confirm Windows installer is signed.

## 4) Ongoing release checklist

1. Ensure `main` is green in CI.
2. Bump app version as needed.
3. Create release tag: `vX.Y.Z`.
4. Push tag.
5. Verify workflow steps:
   - preflight passes
   - release quality checks pass
   - all matrix builds pass
   - `publish_cli` publishes the exact release version before the release job
   - release job uploads expected files
6. Smoke test downloaded artifacts.

## 5) Troubleshooting

- macOS build unsigned when expected signed:
  - Check all Apple secrets plus `APPLE_TEAM_ID` are populated and non-empty.
  - Confirm the provisioning profile belongs to `APPLE_TEAM_ID.com.richardsolomou.ras-code` and includes
    Associated Domains.
- Windows build unsigned when expected signed:
  - Check all Azure ATS and auth secrets are populated and non-empty.
- Build fails with signing error:
  - Retry with secrets removed to confirm unsigned path still works.
  - Re-check certificate/profile names and tenant/client credentials.

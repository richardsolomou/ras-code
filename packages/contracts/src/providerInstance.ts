/**
 * Provider-instance contracts.
 *
 * Splits the historical "provider kind" concept into two:
 *
 *   - `ProviderDriverKind` is the implementation kind selector (e.g. codex,
 *     claudeAgent, a fork's `ollama`, …). It picks which driver package
 *     handles the protocol, the probe, the adapter, and text generation.
 *
 *   - `ProviderInstanceId` is the routing key (a user-defined slug).
 *     Threads, sessions, runtime events, and persisted bindings reference
 *     instance ids — never driver kinds — so a user can configure multiple
 *     instances of the same driver (e.g. `codex_personal` + `codex_work`),
 *     each with independent driver-specific configuration.
 *
 * Forward/backward compatibility invariant
 * ----------------------------------------
 * `ProviderDriverKind` is intentionally an **open** branded slug, not a closed
 * literal union. The server hosts forks, ships in PRs that add drivers, and
 * users frequently roll between branches and forks. Any of those paths can
 * leave `ServerSettings`, persisted thread state, or session bindings
 * referencing a driver that the currently-running build does not know about.
 *
 * The rule: parsing any of those payloads must always succeed, and the
 * runtime is responsible for marking the unknown driver/instance as
 * "unavailable" rather than crashing. Built-in drivers shipped by the core
 * product happens to register in a given build is not part of the contract
 * layer. Driver availability is discovered through the runtime registry.
 *
 * Driver-specific configuration is similarly opaque at the contracts layer:
 * drivers live in (or will be extracted to) their own packages and own their
 * config schemas. The contracts package only knows the envelope.
